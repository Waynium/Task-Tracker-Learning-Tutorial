# Run the Task Tracker in your Browser App

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

This command above starts a client server, which is the front-end for this Task Tracker project.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

### `npm run server`

This command above runs the backend remote server, which keeps all the data from the Task Tracker.
If a task is added, deleted or modified, the backend is notified and the changes are visible to the user.
